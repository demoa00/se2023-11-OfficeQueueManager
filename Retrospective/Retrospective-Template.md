TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 3, 2
- Total points committed vs. done: 6, 9 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 48h, 47h, 

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#1_   |    8    |        |    13      |      19.5    |
| _#3_   |    5    |        |    13.5    |      12.5    |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 0,82

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 3.5 
  - Total hours spent: 3
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
Our evaluations on data structures and on developing. Also, refreshing knowledge about React framework took a different time for everyone.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? 
We learnt a lesson about the importance of communication and the job split. 
We understood how hard is to keep track of the work and to manage all the roles.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
No previous retrospective.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
No previous retrospective.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Set standards, better communication, better organization, more live meetings. To achieve them we're trying to connect with proper channels and to understand better what to do.

  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
We can understand and get along with each other pretty easily.
